I basically started my journey into self-hosting with a Raspberry Pi 1 (the OG version) and a 1.5TB hard drive in 2012.</p> <p>Since then I have spend countless hours learning about self-hosting and building my own infrastructure. Later I switched my career into IT infrastructure despite the fact that I was studying to become an engineer. I am now working as a software and systems engineer at a cloud provider and build Platform as a Service solutions. Working on offering different tools as a service like: Kubernetes, NFS, several databases, and many more.</p> <p>I am thankful for the open source communities and tools which allowed me to learn and build my own career path into IT. I am now giving back to the community by writing this book and sharing my knowledge with you.</p>"},{"location":"resources/","title":"Resources","text":"<p>Listing all resources and links I am using in the book.</p>"},{"location":"resources/#building-your-nas","title":"Building your NAS","text":"<ul> <li>DIY NAS builds by Brian Moses</li> <li>NAS Killer builds by JDM_WAAAT</li> <li>Forum with all the information</li> <li>Serve The Home: Project TinyMiniMicro YouTube Playlist</li> <li>Everything about RAID Controllers/HBA by Art of Server<ul> <li>Art of Server Website</li> <li>eBay Store</li> <li>https://www.youtube.com/c/ArtofServer</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#kvms","title":"KVMs","text":"<ul> <li>PiKVM</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#hardware-raid0","title":"Hardware Raid0","text":"<p>Hardware Raid is Dead and is a Bad Idea in 2022</p>"},{"location":"resources/#hard-drives-and-ssds","title":"Hard Drives and SSDs","text":"<p>Remember: Past performance does not predict future performance.</p> <ul> <li>Backblaze Hard Data and Stats</li> <li>Hard Drive purchasing tips</li> <li>Samsung SSD Reliability by Puget Systems</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#communities","title":"Communities","text":"<p>Communities where you can ask questions, get help and show of:</p> <ul> <li>r/Datahoarder</li> <li>r/Homelab</li> <li>r/Selfhosted</li> </ul> <p>YouTube Channels</p> <ul> <li>Brian Moses</li> <li>Techno Tim</li> <li>Jeff Geerling</li> </ul> <p>Podcasts</p> <ul> <li>https://selfhosted.show/</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#operating-systems","title":"Operating Systems","text":"<ul> <li>Ubuntu</li> <li>armbian</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#nas-os","title":"NAS OS","text":"<ul> <li>TrueNAS Core ++formerly known as FreeNAS</li> <li>TrueNAS Scale</li> <li>OpenMediaVault</li> <li>Unraid</li> <li>Rockstor</li> <li>XigmanAS (former known as NAS4Free)</li> <li>xpenology</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#virtualization-os","title":"Virtualization OS","text":"<ul> <li>Proxmox</li> <li>XCP-ng</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#network-os","title":"Network OS","text":"<ul> <li>pfSense</li> <li>OPNsense</li> <li>VyOS</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#filesystem","title":"Filesystem","text":"<ul> <li>What Is ZFS?: A Brief Primer</li> <li>How Much Memory Does ZFS Need and Does It Have To Be ECC?</li> <li>Tuesday Tech Tip - Linux RAID vs ZFS RAID</li> <li>Book: FreeBSD Mastery: ZFS (IT Mastery)</li> <li>Book: FreeBSD Mastery: Advanced ZFS</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#software","title":"Software","text":"<ul> <li>Awesome-Selfhosted List</li> <li>Docker Compose</li> <li>linuxserver.io - good docker images</li> <li>Flashing Tool: balena etcher</li> <li>Create a Multi ISO USB Stick with Ventoy</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#good-tier-free-services","title":"Good tier free services","text":"<ul> <li>UptimeRobot</li> <li>Grafana Cloud</li> <li>Free prometheus metrics, loki logs, etc.</li> <li></li> </ul>"}]}
