## About the Author

![](Andrej_2000x2000.png){ width="15%" align=left }

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Andrej Friesen, the author of *The self-hosted book*.

I am a self-taught software and systems engineer and a self-hosting enthusiast.
I basically started my journey into self-hosting with a Raspberry Pi 1 (the OG version) and a 1.5TB hard drive in 2012.

Since then I have spend countless hours learning about self-hosting and building my own infrastructure.
Later I switched my career into IT infrastructure despite the fact that I was studying to become an engineer.
I am now working as a software and systems engineer at a cloud provider and build Platform as a Service solutions.
Working on offering different tools as a service like: Kubernetes, NFS, several databases, and many more.

I am thankful for the open source communities and tools which allowed me to learn and build my own career path into IT.
I am now giving back to the community by writing this book and sharing my knowledge with you.
